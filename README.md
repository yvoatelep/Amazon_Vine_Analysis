# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if there is any bias on the part of reviews that were written as part of the Vine program.

## Background and Purpose
The Amazon Vine program allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products from Vine members,who are  provided with free products and then required to publish a review.The purpose of this analysis is to determine if Vine members are biased, as they are in some way compensated for the writing of their reviews. 

## Process 
A large dataset of video game reviews was used for this analysis. The data was filtered to contain reviews that had been received 20 or more reactions and had been voted helpful  by at least 50% of respondents, in order to have a set of reliable and helpful reviews to examine. Then, the percentage of 5 star votes from both Vine members and non-Vine members was calculated. This percentage can be compared to determine if Vine reviews contain bias as a result of getting free merchandise or compensation. 

## Results
From the original dataset of video game reviews, a set of 40,565 reviews was selected for reliability. Of those reviews, only 94 reviews were from Vine members. Of those 94 reviews, 48 of them, or 51%, were 5 star reviews. This seems like a very high percentage, and that becomes more apparent when we look at the second data set. 

Of the 40471 NonVine reviews, 15,663 were 5 star ratings. This represents only 38% of the total NonVine reviews, a 13% difference. This indicates that there is likely some bias in the Vine reviews, and certainly that further investigation is warranted.

## Summary
This initial investigation indicates some bias in the Vine reviews and needs to be repeated on other data sets.
